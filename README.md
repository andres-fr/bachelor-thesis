### BACHELOR THESIS

This repository contains the following work that I've done in the context of my bachelor's thesis, supervised by Professor Visvanathan Ramesh and presented on September 18 at the Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main (Germany). Specifically, it contains:

- The thesis as [PDF file](latex/afr_bachelor_thesis.pdf) as well as the [LaTeX files](latex), [BibTeX references](latex/misc/references.bib) and [assets](latex/misc) that generate it.
- The [slides](latex/presentation/afr_bachelor_presentation.pdf) for the corresponding presentation as well as the [LaTeX files](latex/presentation) that generate them.
- The [Python2 code and metadata](code) as described in the *About the Implementation* chapter of the thesis.
- The [dataset labels](datasets). Keep in mind the [.gitignore](.gitignore) file: audio files are too big to be included, visit <https://dunya.compmusic.upf.edu/carnatic/> for more information on how to get them.
- The [TensorBoard log directory](tensorboard_logs), storing the logs for some of the training runs performed.
